# Intuition

Iteration seems ti be the best option. Iterate through the longest length of both words, appending one character from each word alternately. It is important to handle cases where the strings have different lengths.

# Approach

The first approach is to take consideration of the pointer of every word. So, let's get started by:

1. **String Builder**: Using a `StringBuilder` is efficient because is mutable, unlike a regular `string` which is immutable. This helps in reducing the time complexity.
2. **Pointers**: Pointers are used to keep track of the current index of each word.
3. **Conditionals**: Conditionals are used to append characters only if there are characters left to be added.

# Complexity
- **Time complexity:** O(n), where **n** is the length of the longer string.
- **Space complexity:** O(1), as no additional space proportional to the input size is used.

# Code
```java []
class Solution {
    public String mergeAlternately (String word1, String word2) {
    // ? Create a StringBuilder to efficiently build the result string
    StringBuilder completeWord = new StringBuilder();

    // ? Initialize two pointers to traverse both strings
    int p1 = 0;
    int p2 = 0;

    // ? Iterate through both strings until both pointers reach the end of their res√©pectives strings
    while (p1 < word1.length() || p2 < word2.length()) {
      // ? Append the current character from words if the pointer is within bounds
      if (p1 < word1.length()) completeWord.append(word1.charAt(p1));
      if (p2 < word2.length()) completeWord.append(word2.charAt(p2));
      p1++;
      p2++;
    }
    // ? Convert the StringBuilder to a string and return it
    return completeWord.toString();
  }
}
